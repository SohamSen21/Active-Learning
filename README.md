# Active-Learning
Active learning (also called “query learning,” or sometimes “optimal experimental design” in the statistics literature) is a subfield of machine learning. The key hypothesis is that, if the learning algorithm is allowed to choose the data from which it learns, it will perform better with less training.  
An active learner may pose "queries," usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an "oracle" (e.g., a human annotator) that already understands the nature of the problem.

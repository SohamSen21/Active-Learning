# Active-Learning
Active learning (also called “query learning,” or sometimes “optimal experimental design” in the statistics literature) is a subfield of machine learning. The key hypothesis is that, if the learning algorithm is allowed to choose the data from which it learns—to be “curious,” if you will—it will perform better with less training.
